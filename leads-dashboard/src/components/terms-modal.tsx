              <strong>Kayomarz Pavri</strong>, as the platform's developer and sole intellectual property owner, undertakes to maintain, support, and operate this platform—including bug fixes, security updates, feature development, and server/infrastructure upkeep—for a term of <strong>twenty-five (25) years</strong> from the Effective Date of these Terms, either personally or through a Super User-tier administrator designated for that purpose. This undertaking governs ongoing maintenance responsibility; it does not itself transfer, dilute, or otherwise affect the intellectual property ownership set out in Clause 2, which remains exclusive to Kayomarz Pavri regardless of who is actively performing maintenance at any given time.

              6. Exit, Discontinuation & Transfer of Maintenance Responsibility
            </h3>
            <p className="text-theme-text-secondary">
              Notwithstanding Clause 5, the maintenance commitment described above is not unconditional. Kayomarz Pavri may discontinue active maintenance of the platform, or transfer maintenance responsibility to a successor developer or administrator, under either of the following exit conditions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-theme-text-secondary space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Discontinuation:</strong> Maintenance may be paused or wound down where continuing is no longer reasonably practicable (including but not limited to prolonged unavailability, changed circumstances, or the Centre's own decision to retire or replace the platform), with reasonable advance notice to the Centre Head where circumstances permit.</li>
              <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Maintenance responsibility may be handed to a named successor developer or Super User-tier administrator, provided the transfer is reviewed and approved in writing by the Centre Head before it takes effect. An approved transfer carries forward the same 25-year continuity term under this Clause and Clause 5; it does not reset or extend it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-theme-text-secondary">
              No exit or transfer under this Clause affects the intellectual property ownership set out in Clause 2, which remains exclusive to Kayomarz Pavri unless separately and explicitly assigned in writing.
