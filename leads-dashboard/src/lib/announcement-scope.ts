 * announcement-scope.ts — the single source of truth for "who does an

 *
 * Fixes the recipient targeting that `Member.committee` was meant to cover
 * but never can — every real member has `committee: undefined`; the field
 * that actually holds a value like "Executive Council" is `department`.
 * Ad-hoc scope values that aren't a division or a department (e.g. a named
 * event committee from getCommittees()) are resolved by matching against
 * EventCommittee.memberIds, which only exists nested inside EventItem —
 * not on Member at all.
